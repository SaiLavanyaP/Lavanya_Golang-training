    <h4>
       <b>Difference between Java and Golang<b>
       <p> Go does not need any virtual machine it directly complied its code whereas Java runs on a JVM, which is critical for code compilation.
          Garbage collection is one of Golang’s most important features as it helps in handling more huge codebases than java.
        
       <b>Difference between Python and Golang<b>
        Go is a statically typed language whereas python is a dynamically typed language so it shows more errors at run-time.
        Python doesn’t come with a built-in concurrency mechanism, whereas Go is packed with a built-in concurrency mechanism.
        Python is considered the best when we have to solve data science problems, while Go is best suited for system programming.
        
        <b>Advantages & disadvantages of go</b>
        Advantages:
        Golang is easy to learn as it is a simple language syntax
        Fast compilation and lots of libraries both standard and third-party.
        Disadvantage:
        No inheritance/generics causes some amount of copy/paste for text encoding methods on similar types
        
        <b>Difference between Signed and Unsigned int?</b>
        A signed number has both positive and negative values along with zero whereas an 
        Unsigned contains just zero or positive values. The maximum value of signed number is half that of unsigned number.
        
        int means signed integer which is 32 or 64 bits unless if you need to use a specific sized integer such as int8,int16,int32,int64.
        Uint means Unsigned integer
